title: "1. Create a tenzing sheet"
---

A tenzing sheet is simply a spreadsheet that follows the tenzing template. Here are different ways to create this sheet depending on the tool you want to use to fill it later on, and whether you want to pre-fill it with information gathered on [orcid](https://orcid.org/).

We encourage you to think about how you want to [fill the tenzin sheet](/step2) before creating it.

## Prefilled from orcid information

An R-shiny app can take your list of orcid numbers and create a pre-filled tenzing sheet. The default behavior is to take the current affiliation and funding information. Default credit contribution can be set before uploading the orcid number list.

You can find the app at https://colomb.shinyapps.io/contributorlist_creator/

You can then download the spreadsheet, that you can uplaod to your place of choice, for other authors to confirm and fill it. 

## To GitHub

We have prepared a Github repository template with an empty tenzing sheet. You only have to click the `Use this template` button. Here are a list of GitHub templates having the tenzing sheet.

- TOCOME: Tenzing sheet template
- TOCOME: [Research repository template](https://github.com/tonic-team/Tonic-Research-Project-Template). It also contain specific folder to organise your research project files, see https://gin-tonic.netlify.app/ for details.


## To googlesheet

You may directly want to clone the googesheet we prepared for you. 

Alternatively, you can upload a tenuzing sheet obtained via another tool.
Note also that you can download that sheet anytime if you want to use it with a different workflow.
